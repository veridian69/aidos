# AIDOS — AI Delivery Operating System

*In ancient Greece, Aidos was the spirit of restraint — the inner voice that held you back from hubris. AI gave us the power to build anything. Aidos is the discipline to ask whether we should.*

---

AI collapsed the cost of getting to a first pass. A spec that took a sprint can be drafted in an afternoon. A feature that took a team can be prototyped by one person with an agent. The mechanical cost of software has dropped dramatically.

But the thinking hasn't got cheaper. Humans still need to understand problems, align with each other, and make judgment calls. That part is as slow and expensive as it ever was — and when building is fast, bad assumptions compound faster too.

**AIDOS helps teams think clearly, document decisions, and audit delivery quality — before implementation speed compounds mistakes.**

## What This Actually Is

Four delivery artifacts that build on each other:

**Problem** → **Solution** → **Tech Design** → **Testing**

| Artifact | Question It Answers |
|---|---|
| **Problem** | What is happening, for whom, why it matters, and what success looks like |
| **Solution** | How the proposed response works as a system, including options and trade-offs |
| **Tech Design** | How the response is shaped architecturally — boundaries, state ownership, contracts at seams, invariants, failure posture |
| **Testing** | How we verify it works and trace results back to requirements |

These are delivery artifacts — living documents that stay current as the feature evolves. They are the long-term record.

Each artifact is checked against its own quality rubric **and** against the artifact before it. The Solution has to actually solve the Problem. The Tech Design has to actually implement the Solution. The Testing has to actually verify the Tech Design against the Solution's goals. If the chain breaks, you find out in a review — not in production.

**Rubrics with teeth.** Not "is this good?" — but "can someone unfamiliar with this project understand the problem without prior conversation?" Pass, Partial, or Fail. With cited evidence. The artifact doesn't advance until bugs are fixed.

**Builder/auditor separation.** AIDOS depends on separation between artifact creation and artifact audit. One person sprints ahead with AI to create the artifact. A different person checks it against the rubrics and the preceding artifact. The same person can't be both builder and final judge. That's the governance.

## How It Changes the Way You Work

AIDOS uses pulse-based delivery: short bursts of AI-assisted artifact creation, separated by explicit human review checkpoints.

1. **Sprint** — build an artifact with AI in an afternoon that would've taken a sprint.
2. **Park** — commit, update status, move on.
3. **Align** — bring humans in. They review, react, decide.
4. **Feed back** — process their decisions with AI in minutes, not days.
5. **Sprint again** — or switch to another project while this one waits for the next human checkpoint.

The artifacts hold the state so you can context-switch between projects without losing anything. When Project A is parked waiting for stakeholder review, you sprint on Project B.

## Example

A team needs to improve how warehouse staff track inventory across multiple locations:

| Artifact | What Gets Captured |
|---|---|
| **Problem** | Warehouse staff can't get accurate stock counts without checking three separate systems, taking ~20 min per lookup. Affects 150+ operators making daily restocking decisions. |
| **Solution** | Add a unified stock dashboard to the warehouse management interface. Staff see current counts — accurate within a stated freshness window — inline in the interface they already use. |
| **Tech Design** | Architectural shape: one boundary owns stock-count reads with a stated freshness window. State ownership: the existing inventory source is the single source of truth per item; the dashboard caches a derivation. Failure posture: stale data surfaces with a "data unavailable" indicator rather than blocking the page. |
| **Testing** | Validate data freshness, permissions, rendering across devices, fallback states. Every test traces to a requirement in the Solution. |

The Problem artifact gets audited: is the stakeholder impact clear? Are the goals measurable? Is the scope bounded? Then the Solution gets audited against the Problem: does it actually address the stated goals? Then the Tech Design against the Solution. The chain holds or it breaks at an identifiable point.

## Components

AIDOS is four independent pieces. Pick the ones you need — each has its own README with the same structure: Prerequisites → Install → Use → Develop.

| Component | What it is | README |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | The operating model, rubrics, templates, and prompts. Pure markdown, no build. Usable as-is with any AI that accepts a system prompt. | [`src/README.md`](src/README.md) |
| **Skills** | The framework packaged as four Claude Skills: Builder and Auditor for direct artifact work; Breakdown for decomposing an Epic or Feature into a stub tree; Fanout for coordinating parallel sub-agent build-out of that tree. Published as ZIPs, installable in Claude.ai and Claude Code. | [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) |
| **GitHub MCP Connector** | A local MCP server for Claude Desktop. Lets non-coders read, edit, and publish `.aidos/` artifacts in GitHub repos without touching Git. | [`src/connectors/github/README.md`](src/connectors/github/README.md) |
| **Confluence Publish Connector** | A reusable GitHub Actions workflow that publishes `.aidos/` folders to Confluence on every push. Markdown-to-Confluence translation, content hashing, idempotent. | [`src/connectors/confluence/README.md`](src/connectors/confluence/README.md) |

Each component is optional and independent. Use one, two, three, or all four.

## Quick Start

Pick the path that matches how you want to try AIDOS.

**I just want to try it in an AI chat, no install**
Copy [`src/prompts/builder-prompt.md`](src/prompts/builder-prompt.md) into a Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini session and describe what you're delivering. That's it. Audit a different session with [`src/prompts/auditor-prompt.md`](src/prompts/auditor-prompt.md). For Epic decomposition, use [`src/prompts/breakdown-prompt.md`](src/prompts/breakdown-prompt.md) (auditor checks the stub tree against [`src/rubrics/breakdown.md`](src/rubrics/breakdown.md)), then hand off to [`src/prompts/fanout-prompt.md`](src/prompts/fanout-prompt.md) to drive parallel build-out.

**I use Claude and want a proper skill**
Download all four ZIPs — [`aidos-builder.zip`](https://shobman.github.io/aidos/skills/aidos-builder.zip), [`aidos-auditor.zip`](https://shobman.github.io/aidos/skills/aidos-auditor.zip), [`aidos-breakdown.zip`](https://shobman.github.io/aidos/skills/aidos-breakdown.zip), and [`aidos-fanout.zip`](https://shobman.github.io/aidos/skills/aidos-fanout.zip) — upload to Claude.ai (Settings → Customize → Skills) or extract into `.claude/skills/` in a Claude Code project. Use `/aidos-builder` and `/aidos-auditor` for direct artifact work. For Epic-scale decomposition, use `/aidos-breakdown` to produce a stub tree, audit it, then use `/aidos-fanout` to coordinate parallel sub-agent build-out. See [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md).

**I'm a non-coder and want Claude to author artifacts directly in a GitHub repo**
Set up the GitHub MCP Connector in Claude Desktop: [`src/connectors/github/README.md`](src/connectors/github/README.md). Then install the Skills above. Claude will open a repo, create your personal `aidos/{username}` branch, and publish PRs per your project's write policy.

**I want my artifacts to auto-publish to Confluence**
Add the Confluence publish workflow to your repo: [`src/connectors/confluence/README.md`](src/connectors/confluence/README.md). Every push to your `.aidos/` folder publishes to Confluence. Works on its own, or stacks with the GitHub MCP Connector to close the loop: PO authors via Claude → merge → artifacts appear in Confluence.

---

## How it fits together

The four components compose into a single authoring loop for non-technical contributors:

1. PO or BA opens Claude Desktop → invokes `/aidos-builder` (Skills)
2. Skill detects the GitHub MCP Connector and resolves a repo → creates `aidos/{username}` branch
3. User builds artifacts with the AI (Framework provides the methodology, templates, rubrics)
4. User says "publish" → Skill opens a PR per the manifest's `write` strategy
5. PR merges → Confluence Publish Connector runs via GitHub Actions → artifacts appear in Confluence
6. Engineers see the same artifacts in their IDE via the repo

Each step is optional. You can use the Framework without Skills. Skills without Connectors. GitHub MCP without Confluence. Or any other combination.

## The Rubrics Evolve

Every project that gets burned by something the rubrics didn't catch can make them better.

Six weeks in, nobody owns it? That's a rubric criterion now. Forgot to check if a vendor already solves this? Rubric criterion. Assumed the regulatory requirement was met without verifying? Rubric criterion.

Not just a framework. A continuously hardened review system, built from real delivery failures.

The most valuable contribution to this repo isn't code. It's: *"We got burned by X. Here's the criterion that would have caught it."*
