# AI Delivery Operating System

*Named for Aidos (αἰδώς) — the ancient Greek spirit of restraint, modesty, and respect. The force that holds you back from acting without thinking.*

---

## Purpose

AI has dramatically lowered the cost of producing first-pass artifacts, prototypes, and implementation. A spec that took a sprint can be drafted in an afternoon. A feature that took a team can be prototyped by one person with an agent.

But the thinking hasn't got cheaper. Understanding the problem, aligning stakeholders, and making judgment calls — that's as slow and expensive as it ever was. And when implementation is fast, bad assumptions compound faster too.

AIDOS exists to improve decision quality before implementation speed compounds mistakes. It is an AI-era delivery assurance framework: a structured way to think, decide, and verify before you build — and to keep verifying as you go.

**Minimum viable adoption:** one artifact, one rubric, separate builder and auditor, explicit issue and decision capture. You can adopt AIDOS incrementally — start with the Problem artifact and the Core Rubric, and expand from there.

## Core Model

### The Artifact Stack

Every delivery progresses through four questions, and produces one artifact that outlasts the project:

| Artifact | Question | Lens |
|---|---|---|
| **Problem** | What is happening, for whom, why it matters, and what success looks like | Product |
| **Solution** | How the proposed response works as a system, including options and trade-offs | Analysis |
| **Tech Design** | How the solution will be implemented — components, interfaces, data, constraints | Architecture |
| **Testing** | How we verify it works and trace results back to requirements | Quality |
| **Definition** | What was built, why it works this way, and what a maintainer needs to know | Maintenance |

The first four are delivery artifacts — living documents that build on each other progressively. When new information arrives, it flows backward too — a discovery during Tech Design might reshape the Solution.

The Definition is different. It's created after the work ships, not during delivery. It distills the delivery stack into a single, self-contained description of what was actually built — the authoritative reference maintained as the feature evolves. Everything else archives. See [Post-Delivery Distillation](#post-delivery-distillation) for details.

### The Coherence Rule

Each artifact is audited against its own quality rubric **and** against the artifact that precedes it.

The Solution must visibly solve the Problem. The Tech Design must implement the Solution. The Testing must verify the Tech Design against the Solution's goals. The Definition must accurately describe what was actually built — checked against the Solution and Tech Design, and against the running system itself. If the chain breaks, you find out during a review — not in production.

This isn't bureaucracy. It's traceability. When something goes wrong, you can trace backward through the chain. It either holds or it breaks at an identifiable point.

### Altitude Discipline

AIDOS is for the thinking that happens before the code. Each artifact has an altitude beyond which it must not drift, because the coding session is better placed to decide what lies past it. Three altitude tests anchor the discipline:

- **Problem and Solution altitude test:** *"Could a sentence here name a specific tool, vendor, schema, library, or framework?"* If yes, it's implementation drift — capture in the Overflow Log tagged for Tech Design.
- **Tech Design altitude test:** *"Could this sentence only be written by someone looking at code?"* If yes, it's the wrong altitude — push to the coding session.
- **Testing altitude test:** *"Could this assertion remain true if the implementation changed completely?"* If yes, it's the right altitude. If no, push to the coding session.

These tests are referenced from Core C13 (Implementation neutrality at the right altitude), from the Tech Design rubric, and from the Testing rubric. One discipline, applied at three checkpoints.

### Builder / Auditor Separation

AIDOS depends on separation between artifact creation and artifact audit. The same person cannot be both builder and final judge.

**Builder** — creates and modifies artifacts. The builder holds the pen. A human directs the work, provides context and decisions. AI assists with drafting, structuring, and refining. The builder captures everything: decisions, assumptions, issues, trade-offs. If it happened in the session, it goes in the artifact.

**Auditor** — reviews artifacts against rubrics and checks coherence with the preceding artifact. The auditor does not fix problems — they identify them and send findings back to the builder. Findings are classified as:

- **Bug** — must fix before proceeding. Something is wrong, missing, or contradictory.
- **Risk** — decision required. The human decides: accept, mitigate, or defer.
- **Idea** — noted, not actioned unless chosen. Ideas do not drive additional audit passes.

**The three-pass rule.** Pass 1 is the full assessment. Pass 2 re-audits only the criteria that failed. Pass 3 is the final attempt. After three passes, repeated failure usually signals a structural issue upstream — a flawed assumption or decision in a preceding artifact — not a local drafting problem. Escalate up the stack.

### Rubrics

Every artifact is assessed against two rubric layers:

**Core Rubric** — universal criteria that apply to every artifact at every scale. Alignment to goals. Simplicity. Explicit trade-offs. Failure modes. Testability. Observability. Security. Reversibility. Future team readiness. Unit coherence. No duplication. Implementation neutrality at the right altitude.

**Discipline Rubric** — criteria specific to each artifact type. The Problem rubric (P1–P11) checks clarity, stakeholders, measurability, root cause confidence, scope, assumptions, constraints, impact, alternatives, and implementation neutrality. The Solution rubric (S1–S10) checks coherence, workflows, edge cases, alternatives, dependencies, migration, minimum viable slice, and implementation neutrality. The Tech Design rubric (A1–A10) checks components, integration, data model, error handling, technology choices, performance, deployment, and coding agent readiness. The Testing rubric (T1–T9) checks coverage, traceability, scenarios, exit criteria, expected results, test data, environments, regression, and prioritisation. The Definition rubric (F1–F7) checks outcome accuracy, key trade-offs, maintainer orientation, known limitations, operational context, domain placement, and currency.

Each criterion has a defined "what pass looks like." The auditor assesses Pass, Partial, or Fail with cited evidence. The evidence requirement is what gives rubrics teeth — you can't hand-wave a Pass. Partials are accepted or rejected by the human directing the audit, not waved through. The artifact doesn't advance until bugs are fixed.

Full rubric definitions are in `src/rubrics/`.

### The Artifacts Are the Interface

The artifacts are the interface between people, between sessions, and between humans and AI. If it's not in the document, it doesn't exist for the next consumer — whether that consumer is a colleague, a coding agent, or your future self resuming work next week.

This is especially important for AI-assisted work, where sessions are transient. The artifact is what persists. Everything else is conversation that disappears.

---

## Scaling

Not every piece of work needs the full stack at every level of detail.

**Epic** — a large initiative spanning multiple sprints and people. Problem, Solution, Tech Design, and Test Strategy are each a separate document, plus an Issues Log and an Overflow Log. Every artifact gets thorough treatment because the cost of getting them wrong is high and many people depend on them.

**Feature** — a specific deliverable, one to two sprints, typically one builder. Problem, Solution, and Tech Design are combined into one document. Testing is a separate Test Plan. An Overflow Log is optional — overflow items can go into the parent Epic's log or be tracked inline. If a Feature has no parent Epic, it needs its own Overflow Log. The Problem section can be lightweight if the Epic Problem is strong. The Tech Design section carries the most weight — it's the brief for the coding agent.

**Story** — a day or less of work. Everything lives in a single document. Lean artifacts that inherit heavily from the parent feature. Overflow goes into the parent Feature's Overflow Log, not a separate document. At story scale, the artifacts compress enough that their form changes, so they take different names: Problem becomes Context, Solution becomes User Story, Tech Design becomes Technical Approach, and Testing becomes Acceptance Criteria. They map directly to the four artifact types and are still assessed against the same rubrics at lighter depth.

| Artifact | Epic | Feature | Story |
|---|---|---|---|
| Problem | Problem (full depth) | Problem (focused) | Context |
| Solution | Solution (system-level) | Solution (feature-scope) | User Story |
| Tech Design | Tech Design (architecture) | Tech Design (implementation brief) | Technical Approach |
| Testing | Test Strategy | Test Plan | Acceptance Criteria |
| Definition | Definition (separate) | Definition (separate or section) | — (inherits from parent) |

### Document Structure by Scale

The scale of the work determines the document structure. This is not a suggestion — the builder does not choose how to split artifacts.

| Scale | Document Structure |
|---|---|
| **Epic** | 4 separate documents (Problem, Solution, Tech Design, Test Strategy) + Issues Log + Overflow Log. Post-delivery: separate Definition. |
| **Feature** | 1 combined document (Problem + Solution + Tech Design) + 1 separate Test Plan. Post-delivery: separate Definition if independently deployed; otherwise Definition section in the combined document. |
| **Story** | 1 document containing everything. No Definition — inherits from parent Feature or Epic. |

### Artifact Naming

At Epic and Feature scale, Problem, Solution, and Tech Design keep their names — the depth changes, but the form doesn't. Testing renames at both scales (Test Strategy at Epic, Test Plan at Feature) because it genuinely changes form at each level.

At Story scale, all four artifacts compress enough that they become something different in kind, not just in depth. They take familiar names that reflect their compressed form: Context, User Story, Technical Approach, Acceptance Criteria. The rubrics still apply — the mapping is one-to-one — but the names signal that the builder should think in the compressed form, not try to write a shallow version of the full artifact.

The templates in `src/templates/` provide maximum structure. The builder scales down based on the work — keeping sections brief or skipping them, not switching to a different template. A one-line Assumptions section is better than no Assumptions section.

Scale determines document structure; which artifacts to instantiate is always a human judgment call.

Use judgment. A solo developer building a well-understood API might only need a Problem and a Tech Design. A complex multi-team initiative needs the full stack at epic and feature scale. The framework provides the structure; the human decides how much to use.

### .aidos/ Convention

An AIDOS project root is identified by a `.aidos/` folder. This is where artifacts live. The folder can sit at a repo root, inside a monorepo package, or anywhere the user needs to anchor their delivery work.

Git is the source of truth. Artifacts are authored, committed, and reviewed through the repository — the same way as code. Publishing to other systems (Confluence, GitHub Pages, etc.) is optional and outbound. The `.aidos/` folder and the repo's version history are the canonical record.

Post-delivery, the `.aidos/` folder gains two additional directories:

- **`definitions/`** — the Feature Repository. Definitions are organised by product domain, not by the project that created them. A reader browsing by domain finds the authoritative description of each feature without knowing which project, sprint, or team built it.
- **`archive/`** — delivery artifacts move here when the Definition is accepted. They're the forensic trail, not the maintained reference.

```
.aidos/
  definitions/
    warehouse/
      stock-dashboard.md
    ci-cd/
      deploy-notifications.md
  archive/
    2026-q1-deploy-notifications/
      problem-solution-tech-design.md
      test-plan.md
```

---

## Issues and Decisions

Artifacts accumulate issues and decisions as they're built.

**Issues** are open questions, risks, or unknowns. They're tracked inline in the artifact with status: OPEN, SOCIALISE (needs discussion), or ESCALATE (needs stakeholder decision). Issues are closed by moving them to the Decisions table with resolution, who decided, and date.

**Decisions** are resolved issues. When an issue resolves, it moves from the Issues table to the Decisions table with rationale and date. Decisions don't disappear — they're the audit trail.

**Decision Packets.** When an issue needs escalation, it gets packaged with: the options available, a recommendation, downstream impact, and who needs to decide. This means a stakeholder can make an informed call without re-reading the entire artifact.

**Issues Log.** Escalated items are copied to a centralised Issues Log that tracks what's waiting for a decision across the project and what's been decided. This prevents decisions from getting lost in meeting notes and Slack threads.

**Overflow Log.** Content captured during sessions that can't yet be placed in an artifact — ideas, concerns, design fragments, edge cases that surfaced at the wrong time. Each item is tagged with a probable destination and a status: PARKED (active, waiting), HARVESTED (placed in an artifact or scaffolded), DISCARDED (intentionally killed, rationale recorded), or BACKLOG (out of scope for this iteration, may return). A project cannot close with PARKED items remaining — they must be harvested, discarded, or moved to the backlog.

---

## Working Rhythm

AIDOS introduces a pulse-based working rhythm inside whatever broader planning cadence the team uses — sprints, Kanban, or ad hoc project cycles.

1. **Sprint** — the builder works with AI to create or advance an artifact. Fast, focused, captured.
2. **Park** — the artifact is committed, status updated, ready for review. The builder moves to the next piece of work.
3. **Align** — humans review, react, decide. Meetings happen when they're needed.
4. **Feed back** — meeting outcomes flow into the next builder session. Decisions and corrections are processed with AI in minutes.
5. **Sprint again** — the next artifact or the next iteration, informed by everything that just happened.

The artifacts preserve state across parallel work. When Project A is parked waiting for stakeholder review, you sprint on Project B. The framework ensures nothing is lost in the switch.

### Who Can Build

AI has expanded who can productively draft artifacts. A developer can frame a Problem. A product owner can sketch a Tech Design. An analyst can spike a prototype. The framework reduces dependence on role-based document production, but not on role-based judgment. Stakeholder synthesis, decision hygiene, system coherence — those skills still matter. They just don't have to bottleneck the production of every artifact.

The counter-risk is real: AI enables people to produce plausible first passes outside their specialty, which can create false confidence. That's exactly why the auditor role exists. Anyone can build. But the work must survive a structured audit by someone who didn't create it.

---

## Methodology Fit

AIDOS provides artifact structure and quality standards that work regardless of how you organise delivery.

**When upfront specification works** — the domain is well-known, the decision-maker is one person, the output is for machines to execute — a detailed spec handed to an AI coding agent is effective. Go deep on Problem and Tech Design, minimise iterative checkpoints.

**When iteration is essential** — the output is for humans to interact with, multiple stakeholders need to align, you won't know if it's right until someone sees it — short cycles with frequent feedback are essential. Light Problem, spike fast, show early, iterate.

**Most real work is a mix.** The artifacts and rubrics don't change — only the rhythm and the number of human checkpoints.

The calibration questions at the start of a project:

- How many decision-makers are involved?
- How well-understood is the domain?
- Is the output for humans to interact with or machines to execute?
- How reversible is a wrong choice?
- Does anyone own the outcome?

---

## Rubric Evolution

Rubrics encode lessons from experience. A criterion like "operational ownership is identified and accepted" exists because someone got six weeks into a project and discovered nobody would own the result.

The improvement loop:

1. **Retrospective** — the team identifies what burned them.
2. **Builder session** — a proposed rubric amendment is drafted. New criteria, modified pass conditions, or criteria to retire.
3. **Auditor session** — the proposed changes are reviewed. Are they testable? Non-redundant? Do they actually address the pain point?
4. **Merge** — approved changes enter the rubric with a changelog entry recording what changed, why, and which project drove it.

A good rubric criterion is testable (two people could independently assess Pass, Partial, or Fail and mostly agree), non-redundant (it catches something no other criterion covers), grounded (it comes from real delivery pain), and actionable (if it fails, the builder knows what to fix).

---

## What AIDOS Is Not

AIDOS is a thinking-and-assurance layer. It does not replace:

- **Product strategy** — deciding what to invest in
- **Engineering standards** — coding conventions, architecture patterns, CI/CD
- **Team structure** — how people are organised
- **Backlog or project tools** — Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, Trello
- **Incident management** — what happens when things break in production
- **Delivery planning** — capacity, timelines, dependencies

It sits alongside those things. The artifacts feed into your planning tools. The rubrics complement your engineering standards. The audit process works with whatever review culture you already have.

---

## For AI Agents

The Tech Design artifact is explicitly designed as a coding agent brief. Components, integration points, data model, error handling, constraints — all explicit. An AI agent receiving a Tech Design that passed audit has context that most developers would spend days building up through conversation and code archaeology.

The full artifact chain — Problem through Solution through Tech Design — gives an agent something rare: *why* the code exists, not just what it should do. When an agent understands the Problem, it makes better implementation decisions. When it can reference the Solution, it resolves ambiguities without asking.

The Definition artifact extends this further. When an agent picks up work on an existing feature months later, the Definition provides the authoritative context: what the feature does, why it works this way, what the known limitations are, and what to watch out for when making changes. It's the starting point for any future AI session on the same codebase.

### Agent Autonomy Spectrum

The rubric-based quality model is deliberately agent-agnostic. The artifact stack, the coherence chain, and the builder/auditor separation work the same way whether both roles are human-directed, AI-driven with human oversight, or fully autonomous.

This isn't a future aspiration — it's a current design property. The rubrics define the quality bar. The audit checks against it. The three-pass rule and escalation mechanism are the safety valves. None of these depend on a human being in the loop for every pass. They depend on the rubric criteria being precise enough to assess consistently.

What changes across the spectrum is who initiates the forward pass, how much human oversight each pass gets, and the precision required from rubric criteria. At the human-directed level, a vague criterion is survivable — the human compensates. At the autonomous level, a vague criterion is a system failure. This is why rubric quality matters now: sharper criteria today are the contract that enables safer delegation tomorrow.

For the full treatment — including what changes, what doesn't, and the practical implications — see [Agent Autonomy Spectrum](../docs/maturity-model.md).

## Worked Example

> For a full walkthrough showing the human–AI interaction pattern — including assumption surfacing, audit findings, fix cycles, and escalated decisions — see [Worked Example: Deployment Notifications](../docs/worked-example.md).

The condensed example below shows what AIDOS artifacts contain. The full walkthrough shows how they're built.

**Scenario:** A team needs to improve how warehouse staff track inventory across multiple locations.

### Problem

Warehouse staff can't get accurate stock counts without checking three separate systems, taking approximately 20 minutes per lookup. This affects 150+ warehouse operators making daily restocking decisions. Goal: reduce stock lookup time to under 30 seconds. Non-goal: redesigning the procurement workflow.

### Solution

Add a unified stock dashboard to the warehouse management interface. Pull live counts from the existing inventory sources, surface inline. Two options were considered: embedded dashboard (chosen) vs. separate inventory hub (rejected — adds navigation, doesn't solve the core lookup time problem).

### Tech Design

Query inventory APIs, cache counts with 15-minute refresh, expose via the existing service layer. Component renders stock levels with fallback to "data unavailable." Error handling: stale cache serves last-known-good; API timeout after 3 seconds triggers fallback. No new database tables required.

### Testing

Validate data freshness (counts update within 15 minutes), permissions (only authorised stock data surfaces), rendering across devices, fallback states (API down, no data exists, stale cache). Every test traces to a requirement in the Solution.

### Audit Finding (Example)

On Pass 1, the auditor flagged the Tech Design against the Problem:

| Criterion | Assessment | Evidence | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| A2: Integration points | Partial | API rate limits not addressed. 150+ operators hitting cached endpoint simultaneously at shift changeover — is the cache refresh strategy sufficient? | Risk |

The builder addressed it by adding a pre-warm cache job 10 minutes before each shift change. Pass 2 cleared.

### Escalated Decision (Example)

During the Problem stage, an issue was escalated:

> **I3: Inventory data ownership.** Three warehouse locations maintain separate inventory records with no single source of truth. Which system is authoritative?
>
> **Options:** (A) Use the most recently updated count from any location. (B) Designate one system as authoritative. (C) Surface all with location attribution.
>
> **Recommendation:** Option B — designate one authoritative source. Simplest implementation, clearest accountability.
>
> **Downstream impact:** If Option A or C, the Tech Design needs merge/conflict logic and the Testing scope expands significantly.

Stakeholder decided Option B. Issue moved to Decisions table.

## Post-Delivery Distillation

The delivery stack — Problem, Solution, Tech Design, Testing — serves the team building the feature. Once the work ships, those artifacts become archaeology: valuable for audit trail but not for the people maintaining the software six months later.

The **Definition** is the artifact that survives. It's the final act of a project: a deliberate distillation session at project closure where the builder reviews what was actually built and captures it in a form that's useful to someone who wasn't in the room. This is a separate builder session — not an afterthought or a box to tick, but a distinct step in the project lifecycle.

A project may produce a single Definition or several, depending on what was delivered. An Epic that delivered three features produces three Definitions, one per feature, each filed by its domain. The builder decides the split based on what would make sense to a maintainer browsing the Feature Repository — not based on how the project was structured. The project stack is scaffolding; the Definitions are what persist.

The Definition lives in the Feature Repository (`definitions/`), organised by product domain rather than by project. When someone asks "why does the stock dashboard cache for 15 minutes?" or "what are the known limitations of the notification service?", the Definition is where they look — not the project's Problem or Tech Design documents.

**Why this matters in an AI-assisted world.** Delivery artifacts are co-created with AI sessions that no longer exist. The reasoning that shaped the solution — the assumptions surfaced, the alternatives rejected, the trade-offs weighed — lives in those sessions. If it's not distilled into something that persists, it's gone. Code tells you *what*. The Definition tells you *why*.

**What gets maintained.** Only the Definition. When a subsequent project modifies the feature, the Definition is updated to reflect the new reality. Its status moves from ACCEPTED to CURRENT. The delivery artifacts stay in the archive — they're the forensic trail if anyone needs to understand the original reasoning, but they're not kept current.

**What gets archived.** When the Definition is accepted, the delivery artifacts (Problem, Solution, Tech Design, Testing) move to `archive/` within the `.aidos/` folder. They're not deleted — they're the full decision history. But they're no longer the reference anyone maintains.

**A project cannot close with delivery artifacts unarchived.** Just as a project cannot close with PARKED overflow items, it cannot close without distilling its outcome into Definitions and archiving the delivery stack. The distillation session is how a project ends.

The Definition rubric (F1–F7) is assessed through the Maintenance lens. Full criteria are in `src/rubrics/definition.md`.

---

## Principles

1. **Human directs, AI holds the pen.** AI creates and modifies. The human steers and decides.
2. **The artifact is the interface.** Everything goes in the document. If it's not captured, it doesn't exist.
3. **Just enough to get the thing done.** Good enough to build the next step from — move on. Don't polish.
4. **Rubrics define done.** Quality is assessed against explicit criteria with evidence, not vibes.
5. **The stack is structure, not sequence.** Work flows forward and backward. Earlier artifacts aren't frozen.
6. **Separate building from auditing.** The person who built it is not the person who checks it.
7. **Coherence across artifacts.** Each artifact is checked against its own rubric and the artifact before it.
8. **Capture decisions inline.** When a decision is made, it goes in the artifact immediately with rationale.
9. **Surface issues early.** Unknowns become explicit issues. Escalations get decision packets. Nothing hides.
10. **Challenge scope before committing.** Every item in scope must trace to a stated need. YAGNI.
11. **Show before you're ready.** A working prototype in front of a real stakeholder this week beats a polished solution in six weeks.
12. **The framework waits for humans.** AI makes action fast. Decisions still need people. The rhythm respects that.
13. **Rubrics evolve.** Retrospectives feed lessons back into the quality standards. The framework improves with use.
14. **Delivery artifacts explain the journey. The Definition explains the destination.** The project stack is scaffolding. The Definition is what persists — a living description of what was built, maintained as the feature evolves.
