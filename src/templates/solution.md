SOLUTION ARTIFACT TEMPLATE

What this is:
  The Solution artifact answers: how does the proposed response work as a
  system, including options and trade-offs? It bridges the Problem (what
  we're solving) and the Tech Design (how we build it).

Rubric criteria:
  Core Rubric (C1–C13) — applied to every artifact. Core criteria are
  cross-cutting: you address them through the sections below, not in
  separate sections. In particular:
    C1  Alignment to goals — every element traces to a Problem goal
    C2  Simplicity — simplest approach that solves the problem
    C3  Explicit trade-offs — choices are documented with reasoning
    C4  Failure modes — what can go wrong in the solution design
    C5  Testability — every design choice is verifiable
    C6  Observability — how you'd know if the solution is working
    C7  Security — security implications addressed
    C8  Reversibility — what's hard to undo
    C9  Future team readiness — no tribal knowledge
    C10 Internal consistency — consistent terminology
    C11 No duplication — reference the Problem, don't restate it
    C12 Single unit of work — one coherent solution
    C13 Implementation neutrality at the right altitude — Solution prose
        names no tools/vendors/schemas/libraries unless pre-existing constraints

  Solution Rubric (S1–S9) — discipline-specific criteria:
    S1  Conceptual coherence → Solution Overview
    S2  Workflow completeness → Workflows
    S3  Edge cases → Edge Cases
    S4  Minimum viable slice → Minimum Viable Slice
    S5  Alternatives considered → Alternatives Considered
    S6  Dependency identification → Dependencies
    S7  Migration and transition → Migration and Transition
    S8  Actor identification → Actors
    S9  Constraint compliance → Constraint Compliance

Coherence check:
  The Solution is audited against the Problem artifact. Every goal in the
  Problem has a corresponding response here. Nothing here addresses a
  problem that wasn't stated. If something in the Problem changed, this
  artifact reflects that change.

Scaling depth:
  Epic — full depth. The solution is the system-level design.
  Feature — focused on this feature's response. Reference the Epic
  solution for context.
  Story — keep sections brief.

# Solution: [title]

**Status:** DRAFT | REVIEW | ACCEPTED
**AIDOS Version:** 1.4.0
**Problem:** [link to Problem artifact]

## Solution Overview
<!-- S1: Conceptual coherence. How the solution works as a system.
     All parts connect, no contradictions, no orphaned pieces. -->

[High-level description of the solution. How the pieces fit together
and why this approach was chosen.]

## Scope Boundary
<!-- CONDITIONAL: include only when adjacent responsibilities could be
     confused with this one. The line that says "this is X, NOT Y" — a
     responsibility boundary distinct from Non-Goals (which exclude
     features). Use when readers might reasonably assume this Solution
     owns territory it doesn't. -->

[Statement of what this is NOT, beyond the Non-Goals list. Example: "This
is for local developer iteration and AI cloud containers only. Live
environments are provisioned by INFRA bicep templates, not by compose.
The two patterns are separate by design."]

## Actors
<!-- S8: Actor identification. Who and what interacts with the solution.
     Frequency, skill expectations where human action is required. -->

| Actor | Type | Interaction | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| | Person / Team / System | | |

## Workflows
<!-- S2: Workflow completeness. Trace every workflow end to end.
     Entry points, decision points, handoffs, exit points. No gaps. -->

### [Workflow name]

1. [Entry point]
2. [Step — what happens, who acts, what's the input/output]
3. [Decision point — what determines the path]
4. [Exit point — what state the system is in when done]

## Edge Cases
<!-- S3: Edge cases. Boundary conditions, unusual inputs, atypical
     scenarios. Explicitly deferred items include rationale. -->

| # | Scenario | Handling | In Scope? |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | | | |

## Alternatives Considered
<!-- CONDITIONAL: include only when a genuine fork in the road was rejected
     with rationale. Omit when there was no real alternative (the obvious
     approach was the right one). -->
<!-- S5: Alternatives considered. At least one alternative evaluated.
     The chosen approach is justified, not just the first idea. -->

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A — [chosen] | | | | **Selected** — [reason] |
| B | | | | Rejected — [reason] |

## Dependencies
<!-- S6: Dependency identification. External systems, teams, services,
     data sources, decisions. Status: available, committed, assumed, at risk. -->

| # | Dependency | Type | Status | Risk if Unavailable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP1 | | | | |

## Migration and Transition
<!-- CONDITIONAL: include only when there's a real cutover from a previous
     state. Omit for greenfield work. -->
<!-- S7: Migration and transition. How to get from current state to
     proposed state. Cutover, backward compatibility, rollback. -->

[Current state. Target state. How users, data, or processes move
from one to the other. What happens if the transition needs to be
reversed.]

## Constraint Compliance
<!-- CONDITIONAL: include only when external constraints actually bite the
     design. Omit when constraints are already implicitly satisfied. -->
<!-- S9: Constraint compliance. Map each constraint from the Problem
     to how this solution respects it. Flag gaps explicitly. -->

| Constraint | How Addressed | Gap? |
|---|---|---|
| [from Problem K1] | | |

## Minimum Viable Slice
<!-- S4: Minimum viable slice. The smallest version that delivers
     real value. Viable, not just minimal. -->

**What's in the first slice:**
- [Capability — traces to Problem goal]

**What's deferred:**
- [Capability — reason for deferral]

## Auditor Notes

<!--
Populated by the AIDOS Auditor skill. Rewritten on each audit pass — latest
findings only; git carries the history. Cleared once the artifact is final (no
open Bugs, no new findings on the latest pass).

Findings are classified per framework.md:94-96:
- Bug — must fix before proceeding
- Risk — surface; may become an Issue
- Idea — noted, not actioned
-->

### Bugs (open)
